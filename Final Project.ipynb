    "Each year the city of San Antonio gathers and releases information on the total compensation earned by city workers for the previouse fiscal year. In this analysis, we will be using four datasets containing information on the total compensation for the fiscal years of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Employee compensation includes base salary, certification pay, overtime, leave pay, education pay, tuition reimbursement and allowances. Total compensation includes additional benefits for employees which are contributed by the City, such as pension matching, current employee and retiree healthcare, and wellness contributions. Employees are categorized by three different categories: civilian, uniform police, or uniform fire. "

    "In my analysis, I want to calculate and evaluate the average change in salary between each year, starting from 2014 till 2018. I will take into consideration the employees annual base salary, over time, any additional benefits, job title, gender. For my 2 hypotheses, I hypothesize that each year's datasets males continually earned higher total compensation than females earned. I am predicting that males earned about 5% more than females earned each year. I also hypothesize that city employees' salary increased each year from 2014 to 2018 by 2% each year. Using these data sets, I plan on finding out which city employees have the largest and least annual salaries and whether or not it changed in each year's data set.  "
